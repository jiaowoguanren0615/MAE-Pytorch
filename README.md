## [Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377)

This code is a PyTorch implementation of the MAE model. It is mainly referenced from the [official code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae), and some modifications and customizations have been made based on the source code. The main purpose of this project is to allow users to evaluate the performance of MAE models through the training and validation process using their own datasets. This scalability enables users to customize the MAE model according to their own needs to adapt to a variety of different application scenarios and datasets.
